Step 2: This spatial database was then used with online routing algorithms to derive paths between origin and destinations via the intermediate points. Step 3: Any error in the length of the paths derived and the indicated distances in the excel worksheets given by each Depot was compared and corrections were carried out to minimize the errors. Step 4: The resulting spatial database of trips is used further to assess the accessibility of services provided in the district. The village has access to a bus service if the bus service is within 2 km of the village. Step 5: The results for each Depot are shown in two figures: a) The geographic extent of services within Karnataka and the adjoining states, b) the accessibility with emphasis on less than 10 services a day (shades of green) and villages with no access (red) "],["kalaburagi.html", "2 Kalaburagi", " 2 Kalaburagi In total 2344 trips were mapped for Kalaburagi.
