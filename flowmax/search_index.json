Part I deals with handling FlowMax network (nodes and edges) in a QGIS environemnt and Part II deals with using the FlowMax-Q, a QGIS plugin to work with outputs from FlowMax. Part III deals with visualization of the outputs from FlowMax. The plugin outputs show a bare minimum schema which is necessary for orientation but may not be enough to interpret or print out for dissemination. This part of the manual explains some detailed symbology using QGIS.

Resilience based scenarios (GIS) fall into 2 categories: node-based editing geometries; editing attributes edge-based editing geometries; editing attributes Technology based scenarios will affect the demand (freight composition) Policy based scenarios will affect the route and mode choices (freight composition) "],["scenarios.html", "Section 4 Scenarios", " Section 4 Scenarios The image below shows the underlying structure of constructing scenarios Scenarios "],["adding-links.html", "Section 5 Adding Links 5.1 Connect to an non-existing node 5.2 Connect to an existing node 5.3 Hands-on", " Section 5 Adding Links 5.1 Connect to an non-existing node Is there an existing node at the source or destination of this (to be added) new link? No? First create a node(s) and then create a line between source and destination nodes. Yes ? Create a line between source and destination nodes. 5.2 Connect to an existing node Is the new link connecting to an existing node location? Create a line between source and destination nodes. 5.3 Hands-on 5.3.1 Adding a New Link from an existing node Check the highest node number (NodeIDH) from the node file. To do this, open the attribute table of the shapefile Right Click on the node layer&gt; Open Attribute Table . Scroll if required to see the NodeID field, Click on the field heading to sort the column in ascending or descending order. When in descending order, make note of the top most row to identify the current highest node number. Set the node file in edit mode, and add a node (point geometry) to the node file and assign it a node number = NodeIDH+1 - Fill in all other node attribute columns as necessary (see how) Save edits and stop the edit mode on node file. Check the highest edge number (EdgeIDH) from the link file. Set the link file in edit mode and add a link (line-geometry) from existing node to the new node created in step 2, assign this link an edge number = EdgeIDH + 1 - Fill in all other link attribute columns as necessary (see how) Save edits and stop the edit mode on link file 5.3.2 Adding a New Link from an existing link Check the highest node id (NodeIDH) from the node file. Set the node file in edit mode, and add a node (point geometry) to the node file at the required location on an existing link and assign it a node number = NodeIDH+1 - Fill in all other node attribute columns as necessary (see how) Save edits and stop the edit mode on node file. Split the existing link at this new node from step 2. - When you split the link into two, the first part can retain existing edgeID but the second part needs a new edgeID. Check the highest edgeID number (EdgeIDH) from the link file. Set the link file in edit mode and assign this second part link an edgeID = EdgeIDH + 1 - Fill in all other link attribute columns as necessary (see how) Save edits and stop the edit mode on link file "],["removing-links.html", "Section 6 Removing Links 6.1 Removing a Link (disabling links) 6.2 Adding back an Existing (disabled) Link", " Section 6 Removing Links Removing links is easier than adding links. It is recommended to disable links than to delete them. 6.1 Removing a Link (disabling links) It is advised not to remove a link (line-geometry) in GIS. It is recommended that you use the active attribute in the link shapefile: edit this attribute to a value 0 (integer) instead of a value 1(integer) for the link in consideration. Assigning a 0 will add the current link to a set of inactive links i.e., FlowMax will remove all the links with active = 0 from path building of the Flowmax algorithm 6.2 Adding back an Existing (disabled) Link If you have set the active attribute to 0 to exclude the link(s) from analysis, you can always set the active attribute back to 1 to include the link(s) back into your analysis.
