Part I deals with handling FlowMax network (nodes and edges) in a QGIS environemnt and Part II deals with using the FlowMax-Q, a QGIS plugin to work with outputs from FlowMax.

Resilience based scenarios (GIS) fall into 2 categories: node-based editing geometries; editing attributes edge-based editing geometries; editing attributes Technology based scenarios will affect the demand (freight composition) Policy based scenarios will affect the route and mode choices (freight composition) "],["scenarios.html", "Section 4 Scenarios", " Section 4 Scenarios The image below shows the underlying structure of constructing scenarios Scenarios "],["adding-links.html", "Section 5 Adding Links 5.1 Connect to an non-existing node 5.2 Connect to an existing node 5.3 Adding links - Hands-on", " Section 5 Adding Links 5.1 Connect to an non-existing node Is there an existing node at the source or destination of this (to be added) new link? No? First create a node(s) and then create a line between source and destination nodes. Yes ? Create a line between source and destination nodes. 5.2 Connect to an existing node Is the new link connecting to an existing node location? Create a line between source and destination nodes. 5.3 Adding links - Hands-on Check the highest node number (NodeIDH) from the node file. To do this, open the attribute table of the shapefile Right Click on the node layer&gt; Open Attribute Table . Scroll if required to see the NodeID field, Click on the field heading to sort the column in ascending or descending order. When in descending order, make note of the top most row to identify the current highest node number. Set the node file in edit mode, and add a node (point geometry) to the node file and assign it a node number = NodeIDH+1 Fill in all other node attribute columns as necessary (see also) Save edits and stop the edit mode on node file. Check the highest edge number (EdgeIDH) from the link file. Set the link file in edit mode and add a link (line-geometry) from existing node to the new node created in step 2, assign this link an edge number = EdgeIDH + 1 Fill in all other link attribute columns as necessary (see also) Save edits and stop the edit mode on link file "],["removing-links.html", "Section 6 Removing Links", " Section 6 Removing Links Removing links is easier than adding links. It is recommended to disable links than to delete them.
