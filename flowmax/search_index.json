Resilience based scenarios (GIS) fall into 2 categories: node-based, edge-based. These in turn fall into 2 categories: editing geometries; editing attributes Technology based scenarios will affect the demand (freight composition) Policy based scenarios will affect the route and mode choices (freight composition) "],["scenarios.html", "Section 2 Scenarios", " Section 2 Scenarios The image below shows the underlying structure of constructing scenarios Scenarios "],["adding-links.html", "Section 3 Adding Links", " Section 3 Adding Links Is the new link connecting to an existing link but not at an existing node location? Yes ? First assure that there is a node each for the source and destination of this new link - Yes ? create a line between source and destination nodes. - No? First create a node No? Is the new link connecting to an existing node location? - Yes? First assure that there is a node at the new location at the end of the new link (if the link starts from existing node) "],["removing-links.html", "Section 4 Removing Links 4.1 Removing a Link (disabling links) 4.2 Adding back an Existing (disabled) Link", " Section 4 Removing Links 4.1 Removing a Link (disabling links) It is advised not to remove a link (line-geometry) in GIS. It is recommended that you use the ‘active’ attribute in the link shapefile: - edit this attribute to a value 0 (integer) instead of 1(integer) for the link in consideration. - Assigning a 0 will remove the ‘active = 0’ link(s) from path building of the Flowmax algorithm 4.2 Adding back an Existing (disabled) Link If you have set the ‘active’ attribute to 0 to exclude the link(s) from analysis, you can always set the ‘active’ attribute back to 1 to include the link(s) back into your analysis.
